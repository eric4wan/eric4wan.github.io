<p>Two friends, who are actually twin brothers, came to me with an idea that they
  wanted to move forwards with. They were Business majors, with very little
  technical knowledge, and needed my brilliant CS major brain to give them a hand.
  They told me their idea for hopping on the Uber hype train of "x-sharing" -
  and it was actually pretty good!</p>

<p>The idea was based on the fact that cooking for one is the WORST. You spend
  so much time just feeding yourself, and you don't want to eat the same food
  several days in a row. Cooking for a group would take only a tiny bit more
  time, so if you had a means to vend off extra portions, you could make better
  use of your cooking time AND pick up some money on the side!</p>

<p>I grilled them on the logistics of how everything would play out. In the end,
  I constructed a list of use cases, with each and every step listed. With the
  process documented, I was able to sketch out a basic storyboard and then
  a wireframe of both sides of the app: vendor and vendee.</p>

<p>I gave a lot of direction on this particular project and got to flex my
  product management muscles. I knew what logistical issues to work out in the
  business model - as well as how to expedite the process of getting cooked food
  into the hands of a customer. I pushed my friends to do the first round of
  customer discovery - we wrote a survey to give out to other Tech students.
  And it turned out great!</p>

<p>On the flip side, I'm very knowledgeable on how to develop the application.
  Undergoing the storyboarding process brought up technical questions (that I
  kept to myself) and business questions that we discussed together. We decided
  to go with Android over iOS not just because I have Android/Java experience,
  but also, Android holds the larger market share and we all use Android devices
  lol.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I've been far too busy to start coding. We started in summer,
  but I was interning full-time with a 1-hour commute each way, so I wasn't
  giving up the little free time I had/my sanity for this. And I'm working part-time
  during this school year, with a massively overfull plate, so I'm holding off
  on development for now.</p>

<p>However, HackGT is coming up! We're all going, and I have other smarty-pants
  friends going too, so we might take this for a spin. It's a very solid idea
  and we've worked out so many of the finer details, so I'm excited!</p>
