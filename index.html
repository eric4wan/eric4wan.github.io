<p>My name is Eric Wan, and I'm a 2nd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My threads are Information/Internetworks and People. <a href="resume">Have a look at my resume!</a></p><!-- enjoy!  -->
<p>From the start, I wanted to do UI/UX, but didn't really know how to get started. I also could definitely see myself stepping into a Project Manager role, or other upper management. I enjoy responsibility, handle stress well, and can balance many tasks at once. Don't believe me? For every day of middle and high school, on average, I had swim practice for 3 hours, piano for 1, and violin for another. EACH DAY. I can handle stress.</p>
<p> Recently, I've started working on a project that I hope will at least place (if not win) at InVenture 2016! My buddy and I are working on a  mask for firefighters You can find more about it <a href="firefighter">here.</a> I should have a more complete features list shortly</p><!-- if i ever get time -->
<p>I'm going to be updating this website with whatever progress I make in my field, whenever I can. It's going to be my personal hobby, as well as a place to practice and demonstrate my skills. The plan is to eventually create more websites, maybe using Angular, Rails, PHP, or anything else, and link to them from here. It'll be a great start at a portfolio! Oh and, chances are you'll get a kick out of whatever comments I leave in the source code.</p>
