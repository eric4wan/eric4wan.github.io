<p>My name is Eric Wan, and I'm a 3rd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My threads
  are People (Human-Computer Interaction) and Media (Information Visualization).</p>
<p><a href="resume">Have a look at my resume!</a></p>

<p>I'm using this website to show off a little - you can pore through my amazing
  resume, and if anything catches your eye, you can (probably) find more info
  on it here below, as well as my progress/current status on each project!</p>

<p>Let's start with the "Wanitor" (I didn't name it) This past summer, I interned at a wonderful
  startup called <a href="aliihealthcare.com">Alii Healthcare</a> where I met
  some of the most wonderful, brilliant, and hard-working people I know. They've
  developed an iOS app that connects you to licensed ER physicians to diagnose,
  treat, and prescribe any medical conditions you have - with none of the wait
  or cost of an ER visit (check them out, they're truly doing healthcare right).
  I took on the project to build a web app dashboard (from scratch!!) to display
  information/metrics for our use. Because of HIPAA and all, I don't currently
  have any pictures or demos of it, but I hope to rig up some dummy data so that
  everyone can see how cool it is!</p>

<p>Next, we have "Fuber" - the working title for the Android app some friends
  and I are working on. It's like Uber, but for food! You can sign up to cook
  whatever food, whenever you want, and vend it out to anyone who wants it!
  <a href="fuber">Hungry for more?</a></p>

<p>Then, "FireHUD" - another title that... could use some work. Some friends
  and I are building a heads-up-display to be mounted on a firefighter's mask
  to provide them with information/data that has the potential to save lives.
  <a href="firefighter">Turn up the heat!</a></p>
