<p>Despite losing 1-3 in a best-of-five series to UNC's Hearthstone team, the "Hearth Heels", Georgia Tech's very own e-athletes stay undefeated due to a scheduling error in week 2 of the Spring season.</p>
<!-- picture representing Gt hearthstone -->
<p>As part of the Collegiate StarLeague (CSL) series, GT Hearthstone faces off head-to-head with other universities throughout North America and Europe. The Spring season comprises of a 6-week Round Robin before the playoffs. Each team brings their 5 best players and their best decks - but no two members may use the same in-game "hero" class, of which there are 9 total. Players will only play once in a predetermined order, win or lose, and the first team to 3 victories takes the match.</p>

<p class="caption">The Collegiate StarLeague is open to all accredited universities in North America/Europe. It is a growing source of e-sports competitions for a number of games popular in the competitive scene. Their website is listed <a href="http://www.cstarleague.com/">here.</a></p>
<p>The game began at 6pm EST on Saturday the 30th, and Captain Zack Braun started off with a quick victory to bring the GT team up 1-0. But the Hearth Heels replied with a resounding rebuttal and swept the rest of the series. I had a chance to speak with Zack and a few other members shortly after their surprising defeat.</p>
<p class="bigger">"Yeah... it was kind of rough. We just had 3 rounds of bad luck finish it off. It sucks because we beat them last season no problem - we beat everyone last season haha"</p>
<p>And indeed, GT Hearthstone <a href="http://www.cstarleague.com/hs/news_articles/158">won the Collegiate StarLeague last semester</a> - undefeated throughout the regular season AND the playoffs, taking home a nice $2,000 check to split amongst themselves.</p>

<p class="caption">Because Hearthstone lacks a true "spectator" mode, streams were spectated and broadcasted from McGill's point of view.</p>
<p>The Yellow Jackets were devastated by their loss - the last time they met, it was the Hearth Heels who had lost 1-3 - but in a shocking turn of events, a CSL Admin deleted the match results.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the preliminary schedule had originally listed the two teams to face off at 6pm on Saturday, but the updated schedule moved the two teams to next <i>Friday</i> so they could be broadcasted on the CSL stream on Twitch.tv, the largest streaming platform for a wide variety of e-sports entertainment.</p>
<p>The Admin ruled that the streaming schedule took precedence, and that the GT team would have a chance to redeem themselves on Friday, where they would be broadcasted for all to view, complete with two commentators, or "casters", as they're called in the gaming community.</p>
<p>So, the GT team has no losses recorded for this season. They will battle it out again with the Hearth Heels on Friday the 5th at 10pm EST, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/cstarleague/">right here</a>, to kick off the start of hopefully another stellar season.</p>
