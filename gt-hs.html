<p>Despite losing 1-3 in a best-of-five series to UNC's Hearthstone team, the "Hearth Heels", our very own e-athletes stay undefeated due to a scheduling error.</p>

<p>As part of the Collegiate StarLeague (CSL) series, GT Hearthstone faces off head-to-head with other universities throughout North America and Europe. The Spring season comprises of a 6-week Round Robin before the playoffs. Each team brings their 5 best players and their best decks - but no two members may use the same in-game "hero" class, of which there are 9 total. Players will only play once in a predetermined order, win or lose, and the first to 3 victories takes the match for their school.</p>

<p>The game began at 6pm EST on Saturday, and Captain Zack Braun started off with a quick victory to bring the GT team up 1-0. But the Hearth Heels made a significant rebuttal and swept the rest of the series. I had a chance to speak with Zack and a few other members shortly after their surprising defeat.</p>
<p>"Yeah... it was kind of rough. We just had 3 rounds of bad luck finish it off. It sucks because we beat them last season no problem - we beat everyone last season haha"</p>
<p>And indeed, GT Hearthstone won the Collegiate StarLeague last semester - undefeated throughout the regular season AND the playoffs. </p>
